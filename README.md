uses openweather.org api. sign up on this website and get your own api key, replace the url in weather.js and do a npm install after you unzip the file and have 'cd'ed into the directory so that when you do a ls you see app.js file listed. Once you have the depdencies installed by doing 'npm install' run the app by typing node app.js this will give you weather output in your terminal. note that no db or webservices features are added. this app was built purely for training purpose only and to demonstrate how to work with json, apis and advanced promise. so go ahead clone and explore.
